    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML are to be desplayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="one"> Css is not necessary </span><b>CSS saves a lots of work.</b>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
        <li class="raw">External style sheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common ways to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal CSS,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a special element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles cab be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors avaliable. Two or the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
